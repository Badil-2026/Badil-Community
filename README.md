# Main entry point — who we are, mission, how to join, etc.
# 🌿 Badil-Community

**BADIL** is a community-driven initiative built around the belief that **real change begins with shared moral responsibility, transparency, and collective decision-making**.

We are not yet a registered entity — we are **a group of people** coming together to experiment with **new forms of democratic organization**, powered by technology and guided by shared principles.

---

## 🌍 Our Vision

To build a **transparent, morally grounded, community-governed ecosystem** that empowers people to collaborate, decide, and act together — outside of centralized control.

---

## 🎯 Our Goals

- Establish a **Decidim platform** for open participation and democratic decision-making.
- Create a **transparent and documented foundation** for our movement’s growth.
- Build internal **collaboration tools** (GitHub, Drive, etc.) to organize our work.
- Define **roles and assemblies** for community self-governance.
- Spread awareness about **ethical, decentralized, and transparent governance**.

BADIL means *alternative* — a new way to organize society, projects, and governance.

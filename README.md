# 🌿 Badil-Community

**BADIL** is a community-driven initiative built around the belief that **real change begins with shared moral responsibility, transparency, and collective decision-making**.

We are not yet a registered entity — we are **a group of people** coming together to experiment with **new forms of democratic organization**, powered by technology and guided by shared principles.

---

## 🎯 Our Goals

- Establish a **Decidim platform** for open participation and democratic decision-making.
- Create a **transparent and documented foundation** for our movement’s growth.
- Build internal **collaboration tools** (GitHub, Drive, etc.) to organize our work.
- Define **roles and assemblies** for community self-governance.
- Spread awareness about **ethical, decentralized, and transparent governance**.

## 🔭 Vision at a glance

- Build a community-governed digital ecosystem where trust is encoded, accountability is transparent, and collaboration replaces exploitation. See the full vision in [VISION.md](VISION.md).
- Phase One focus:
  - Build the platform for democratic participation and collaboration.
  - Form a transparent association governed by the platform itself.
  - Prove the model with real projects, partnerships, and services.

## 🧭 Strategic directions

- 🛠️ BADIL Works — Ethical workspace for developers, designers, and innovators to deliver useful projects transparently and fairly.
- 🏗️ BADIL Systems — Modular governance tooling offered ethically to communities and organizations that want transparent decision-making.
- 📊 BADIL Insights — Truthful, consent-based analytics that turn community voices into responsible, human-centered insight.

# Contributing to BADIL

## 1) Ways to contribute
- Share ideas and proposals on Discord or Telegram
- Join working groups on Discord and Telegram 
- Open issues for bugs or suggestions
- Submit pull requests for features or fixes

---

## 2) Propose ideas (Decidim/Discord)
We'll use Decidim/Discord to make proposals, gather feedback, and decide collectively.

When creating a proposal at https://focusthing.com, or Discord proposals channel include:
- Problem to solve (why now?)
- Moral rationale (which principles this supports)
- Expected impact (who benefits and how)
- Needed resources (people, skills, time)
- Next steps (MVP scope, success criteria)

Small suggestions and housekeeping can be filed as GitHub Issues, but strategic items should live in Decidim/Discord for visibility and voting.

---

## 3) Decision flow (high level)
1. Proposal is published on Decidim
2. Discussion window (collect comments and alternatives) on Decidim/Discord
3. Moral check against our principles (Transparency, Community ownership, etc.)
4. Vote (if required by scope)
5. Outcome recorded; tasks created (GitHub issues and Discord and Drive docs)
6. Implementation tracked publicly; results are summarized back to Decidim

---

## 4) Working groups
- Join Discord: https://discord.gg/XbCuWGt5yA
- Introduce your skills and interests in the appropriate channel
- Coordinators help split tasks and align with the current Roadmap

---

## 5) Pull request (PR) workflow
- Fork or create a feature branch from main
- Branch name: type/short-topic (e.g., docs/readme-structure, feat/roadmap-v1)
- Keep PRs small and focused; link related Decidim proposal and GitHub issue
- Describe: context, change summary, testing/verification, impact on docs
- Request review from at least one maintainer; be open to feedback
- Merges follow the decision flow for significant changes

Commit style: keep messages clear and imperative (e.g., "Add Roadmap v1 and link in README").

---

## 6) Conduct and values
We operate by the BADIL principles: morality before profit, transparency by default, community ownership, decentralized power, accountability in code, education and inclusion, anti-speculation, and reinvestment.

Be respectful and constructive. If issues arise, escalate to coordinators on Discord/Telegram.

Please read our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for detailed expectations, unacceptable behavior, reporting, and enforcement.

## 7) Questions
Open a GitHub Issue or ask in Discord/Telegram. For strategic direction, use Decidim to keep discussion public and traceable.

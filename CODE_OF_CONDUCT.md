# BADIL Code of Conduct

Built on morality. Powered by technology. Owned by the community.

This Code of Conduct sets behavioral expectations for everyone who participates in BADIL spaces and projects (Decidim, Discord, Telegram, GitHub, documents, meetings, and events). It complements our moral principles and the decision process outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Our moral principles
We operate by the principles documented in README.md:
1) Morality before profit
2) Transparency by default
3) Community ownership
4) Decentralized power
5) Accountability in code
6) Education and inclusion
7) Anti-speculation
8) Reinvestment into moral and social development

These principles are not slogans—they are the standard by which we design systems and behave.

---

## Expected behavior
- Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive; assume good intent
- Communicate transparently: share context, decisions, and trade-offs publicly whenever possible
- Credit fairly and acknowledge contributions
- Seek consent for data collection and share insights responsibly
- Align proposals and implementations with BADIL’s moral principles
- Use Decidim for strategic proposals so discussions and votes are traceable
- Follow the PR workflow and request feedback early

---

## Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or discrimination of any kind
- Manipulation of/in processes; misrepresentation of facts
- Doxing, privacy violations, or sharing confidential information without consent
- Spam, self-promotion unrelated to community goals, or off-topic disruption
- Circumventing community decisions or governance to push private agendas

---

## Reporting and support
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or need help:

1) Immediate support (real-time)
   - Contact moderators on Discord or Telegram
   - Move heated discussions to a moderated channel or to asynchronous written form

2) Formal report (traceable)
   - Send a private message to moderators on Discord or Telegram requesting a triage dialog

Please include, where possible: what happened, when/where, links/screenshots, and what outcome you’re seeking. We will handle reports as discreetly as possible while honoring transparency requirements.

---

## Enforcement
- Moderators and coordinators may take any of the following, depending on severity and context:
  - Conversation guidance, clarification of expectations
  - Request to edit or remove content; temporary message moderation
  - Temporary removal from specific channels or activities
  - Formal warning recorded in project docs
  - Escalation to a Decidim process when community decision is appropriate
  - Suspension or removal from community spaces (Discord/Telegram/GitHub/meetings)

Enforcement aims to restore safety, uphold the moral principles, and maintain a productive environment—not to punish unfairly. Appeals can be requested via a Decidim proposal when appropriate.

---

## Governance alignment
- Strategic or precedent-setting enforcement outcomes may be summarized (anonymized when needed) and referenced in Decidim for community awareness and future improvement.
- Changes to this Code of Conduct should be proposed in Decidim and updated via PR referencing the decision.

---

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is informed by community norms and inspired by the spirit of the Contributor Covenant while being adapted to BADIL’s moral framework and transparent governance model.
